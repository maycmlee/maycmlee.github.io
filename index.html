			Git Stash</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We started our second project mode last week.  Compared to the first project mode I&rsquo;m feeling more comfortable with using Github.  Here, I just wanted to go over the <b>git stash</b> command because I&rsquo;ve found it really helpful when I need to put a feature I&rsquo;m working on on hold to work on something else.</p>

<p>So, for example, say I&rsquo;m trying to write a new feature, but was asked to fix a bug in another part of the code.</p>

<p>So if I did <code>git status</code></p>

<p>I get&hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>On branch new_feature
</span><span class='line'>Changes not staged for commit:
</span><span class='line'>  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
</span><span class='line'>  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  modified:   app/models/country.rb
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I don&rsquo;t really want to commit my test code yet because it&rsquo;s only half done. So, instead, I can do <code>git stash</code> which is like a &lsquo;pause button&rsquo; for your current work.</p>

<p>By doing <code>git stash</code> you save your work on your local directory and clear out your working directory.</p>

<p>After fixing the bug, to get back the work I was doing before I just have to use <code>git pop</code>, which gives me the most recent work I have stashed.</p>

<p>You can also stash more than one work-in-progress and git the list of stashed by using <code>git stash list</code></p>

<p>You can see all of your stashes by using <code>git stash list</code></p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>stash@{0}: WIP on new-feature: 5cedccc Write new feature
</span><span class='line'>stash@{1}: WIP on new-feature: 9f44b34 Try different method
</span><span class='line'>stash@{2}: WIP on new-feature: 5acd291 Start new feature</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

			Transpilers or Source-to-Source Compilers</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Yesterday before we started learning Ember we were given a crash course in Babel, a transpiler or transcompiler, for Javascript.  I had never heard of transpilers so decided to look a little more into them.</p>

<p><b>Transpilers</b> are also known as <b>source-to-source compilers</b>, meaning they translate the source code of a program written in one language into a source code written in another language.  These two source code languages have similar levels of abstraction and are both high-level languages, like Ruby, Python, or JavaScript.</p>

<p></center></p>

<p>A <b>compiler</b>, on the other hand, translates the source code of a high-level language program to a low-level language, such as machine code, which is understood by the computer&rsquo;s CPU.</p>

<center><img src="images/high-to-low-level-languages.png" width=250px>
<br><small>Source: <a href ="http://learntocodewith.me/programming/source-code">Learn to Code With Me</a></small></center>


<p>CoffeeScript, TypeScript, Dart, ECMAScript 6 (ES6) are just a couple of languages that transpile to JavaScript.</p>

<p>Why use a JavaScript transpiler?</p>

<p>Different transpilers also offer different advantages.  For example, CoffeeScript has similarties to Ruby and Python and implments some of the features from those two languages.  So if you know Ruby or Python then CoffeeScript might feel more familiar and be easier for writing JavaScript programs.</p>

<p>Typescript, another example, is a superset of JavaScript which means that any JavaScript code you write would work with it, but Typescript offers more object oriented programming features than JavaScript alone.  Also, Typescript has similarities to Java and C# so would be easier to program in if you already know those languages.</p>

<p>ES6 is JavaScript compiled to JavaScript, but with many additional features that have just been approved in June by ECMA International.  ES5, the previous version, was approved back in 2009 so major improvements and new features can be found in ES6.  However, even though these new features have been approved, it will take time for browser developers to update their browsers so that ES6 features can be used.  But even so, if web developers want to start using these new features they can do so because Babel transpiles ES6 back to ES5.</p>

			Yelp API Keys and tokens....oops</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For our project, we&rsquo;re using a Yelp API to help us find restaurants in a specific neighborhood.  To get access to the API we generated keys and tokens from Yelp&rsquo;s developer website.</p>

<p><img src="images/yelp_secret.png"></p>

<p>These keys and tokens allow us to make a HTTP request to the Yelp API to get the information we want.</p>

<p>To keep these API keys safe, we first stored them in a separate YAML file called <b>application.yml</b>.</p>

<p>Inside application.yml:<br><br>
<img src="images/yaml_file.png"></p>

<p>And then we can created a <b>.gitignore</b> file that lists our <b>application.yml</b> in it.  Doing this allowed us to keep application.yml from being pushed up to GitHub and keep people from getting a hold of our API keys.  A <b>.gitignore</b> file contains a list of files that are not to be pushed up to GitHub.</p>

<p>So when we wanted to make a request to our API, we had to first <b> load </b> the file <b>application.yaml</b>.<br><br>
<img src="images/load_yaml.png"></p>

<p>&hellip;which gave us a hash of our API keys and tokens: <br><br></p>

<p><img src="images/keys.png"></p>

<p>&hellip;and then we made the actual request to the API by sending over our API keys as key-value pairs from our hash. <br><br>
<img src="images/protected.png"></p>

<p>However, because we wanted to see if we could just get the API code working, we decided to hardcode the keys in first&hellip;<br><br>
<img src="images/hardcoded.png"></p>

<p>Then an hour or so later&hellip;.we got the API working and were able to get the information we were looking for from Yelp.  Yay!  git add. git commit.  git push.  OOPS.  We had just completely exposed our API keys to everyone.</p>

<p>So, how do we resolve this problem?  The problem with just fixing our code, hiding our API keys, and then pushing the code back up to GitHub was that all of our previous git commits still contained those keys.  So, the best thing to do was to destroy those keys and generate new ones.  And not expose them again.</p>

<p>Our case was not too serious, hopefully. However, there have been a number of cases where programmers who used Amazon Web Services (AWS) had mistakenly published their tokens on GitHub and ended up getting their accounts hacked into.  One programmer using AWS realized his keys were revealed in his code just five minutes after he commited his files to GitHub.  So he immediately reverted his last few commits and deleted all traces of his keys from GitHub.  But the next morning he had four emails from Amazon AWS, a missed phone call from them and 140 servers running on his AWS account, along with a bill for $2375.  So his keys were discovered within those five minutes they were exposed on GitHub.  Luckily, when he explained the situation to Amazon customer support, they dropped the charges.</p>

<p>You can find the full story here: <a href="http://www.devfactor.net/2014/12/30/2375-amazon-mistake/"> My $2375 Amazon EC2 Mistake.</a></p>

			What It All Comes Down to...Binary Code</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>While I was working on the &ldquo;Secret Handshake&rdquo; lab, I became interested in binary codes.  I knew vaguely that computers at the lowest level operated on a binary system, but I didn&rsquo;t quite understand what that meant. How does a computer understand what we are asking for when we run a program?  I decided to do a little investigation.</p>

<p>First, I found out that a computer, in terms of its hardware, can actually only understand the states of &lsquo;on&rsquo; and &lsquo;off&rsquo;.  So everything a computer does is based on a combination of turning switches (transistors) on and off. These on and off states are represented by the binary code of 0&rsquo;s and 1&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>So what is the binary number system?  Our counting system is a base-ten system, meaning we have digits from 0 to 9.  The binary number system or base-two contains only 0 and 1.</p>

<p>So how do we convert our regular decimal numbers into binary code?</p>

<p>For example, how do we convert 14 into binary code?</p>

<p>14/2 = 7 remainder <b>0</b></p>

<p>7/2&nbsp;&nbsp; = 3 remainder <b>1</b></p>

<p>3/2&nbsp;&nbsp; = 1 remainder <b>1</b></p>

<p>1&#47;2&nbsp;&nbsp; = 0 remainder <b>1</b></p>

<p><b>1110</b> in binary = <b>14</b> in our decimal counting system.</p>

<p>But what about the alphabet and other symbols such as #, &amp;, % and etc?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) table comes in.  The ASCII table converts the upper case, lower case alphabet and symbols into a decimal number.</p>

<p><img src="images/asciitable.png"></p>

<p>Another <a href="http://www.ascii.cl/htmlcodes.htm" target=_blank>ASCII table</a>.</p>

<p>From the decimal number the computer can then convert it into a binary number.</p>

<p>For example, let&rsquo;s take the capital letter &ldquo;A&rdquo;.  Looking at the ASCII table we see that it is 65.  Converting 65 into a binary number&hellip;</p>

<p>65/2 = 32 remainder = <b>1</b></p>

<p>32/2 = 16 remainder = <b>0</b></p>

<p>16/2&nbsp;= 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;remainder = <b>0</b></p>

<p>8/2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;remainder = <b>0</b></p>

<p>4/2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;remainder = <b>0</b></p>

<p>2/2&nbsp;&nbsp; = 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;remainder = <b>0</b></p>

<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remainder = <b>1</b></p>

<p>Binary code for &ldquo;A&rdquo; is <b>1000001</b>.</p>

<p>And the binary code for a string like &lsquo;Hello World&rsquo; is&hellip;</p>

<p>01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100000 01010111 01101111 01110010 01101100 01100100</p>

<p>I found it fascinating that everything we input into a computer is at the end read and understood by the computer as a long long string of 0&rsquo;s and 1&rsquo;s.</p>
