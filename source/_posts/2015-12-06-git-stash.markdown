We started our second project mode last week and I'd like to talk about *__git stash__*, which I've found really helpful for when I need to put something I'm working on on hold to work on something else.

So, for example, say I'm trying to write a new feature, but was asked to fix a bug in another part of the code.  

If I did ```git status```

I get...

```
On branch new_feature
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

  modified:   app/models/country.rb

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

I don't really want to commit my test code yet because it's only half done. So, instead, I can take a snapshot of my current work using ```git stash```.


By doing ```git stash``` you save your work on your local directory and clear out your working directory.

```
Saved working directory and index state WIP on new_feature: fb67f7a This is a test
HEAD is now at fb67f7a another test
```

After fixing the bug, to get back the work I was doing before I just have to use ```git pop```, which gives me the most recent work I have stashed.

To stash with a message you can do... 

```
git stash save "This is a test"
```

You can also stash more than one work-in-progress.  And to get a list of all of your stashes you can use 

```
git stash list
```

...which gives you...

{% codeblock %}
stash@{0}: WIP on new-feature: 5cedcc This is a test
stash@{1}: WIP on new-feature: 9f4434 Try different method
stash@{2}: WIP on new-feature: 5acd291 Start new feature
{% endcodeblock %}

*__git pop__* only gives you the most recent stash so if you wanted to get *__stash@{1}__* you would do
```
git stash apply stash@{1}
```
This has been really helpful when I'm trying to solve a problem but want to try different methods. So I can try one method, stash it and try another method and then use the one I want.
