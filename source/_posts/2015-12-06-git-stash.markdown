We started our second project mode last week and I want to talk about <b>git stash</b> I've found it really helpful for when I need to put something I'm working on on hold to work on something else.

So, for example, say I'm trying to write a new feature, but was asked to fix a bug in another part of the code.  

If I did ```git status```

I get...

```
On branch new_feature
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

  modified:   app/models/country.rb

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

I don't really want to commit my test code yet because it's only half done. So, instead, I can take a snapshot of my current work using ```git stash```.

By doing ```git stash``` you save your work on your local directory and clear out your working directory.

After fixing the bug, to get back the work I was doing before I just have to use ```git pop```, which gives me the most recent work I have stashed.

To stash with a message you can do... 

```git stash save "This is a test"```

You can also stash more than one work-in-progress.  And to get a list of all of your stashes you can use ```git stash list```

```
stash@{0}: WIP on new-feature: 5cedccc This is a test
stash@{1}: WIP on new-feature: 9f44b34 Try different method
stash@{2}: WIP on new-feature: 5acd291 Start new feature
```

```git pop``` only gives you the most recent stash so if you wanted to get stash@{1} you would do ```git stash apply stash@{1}```

This has been really helpful when I'm trying to solve a problem but want to try different methods.
